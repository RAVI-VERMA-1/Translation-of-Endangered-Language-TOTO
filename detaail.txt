How crow hen killed black snake	heppa jamS’a cabe aja daS’ua puyahiM S’aena

We have lived here a long time. I can’t bear to desert my home and go to live elsewhere” said the crow. While they were talking they heard a hissing sound just below them. They knew what the sound meant. They sat helplessly in their nest trying to protect their eggs. The black snake crept higher and closer to the nest. Then with a loud hiss he tried to strike at the birds who flew away in terror. One by one, the black snake swallowed the eggs		eintiya ita yuMwaha oiS’e lohae. ka i S’a witimS’a hako tuMSiMso macana dambe aja jaMnehe. abiyesmi kokoita ‘his’ tamS’a abiko liS’o kayna he. haMkaime akua abi Mainahe haijakomacudo aja cabeha bassata keitu bemS’e yuMnahe

If the black snake eats up my eggs this time also, I refuse to live in this tree any longer. We must build our nest somewhere else” said the mother bird to her husband		epraM keitui puiya i punaha ka i siMeko bassata yumkoirwa tamS’a cabe ajaha ako dambe ajahe jaMnahe. epraM jaMnahe i siMe witimS’a dosra siMeta bassa bane neruwa

The parents came back sadly to their nest, knowing well that they would find it empty. The crow said, I must find a way to destroy this murderous snake 	aja dambe cabe lawomS’a woMnahe ado abi gemmi abigo bassata haire matto. dambe aja jaMnahe I puya hiM keito aMcaMwa hepay jamS’a jiMdo S’eruwa

How can you ever fight him? His sting is so deadly”, said his wife in despair.	cabe aja S’aS’imsa jaMnahe puyako cowwa S’ipkaro akuimpa hepajamS’a luiS’koikoga

Don’t you worry, my dear, I have got a friend who is cunning enough to destroy the most poisonous of snakes” said the crow, and off he flew to another tree under which lived his dear friend, the jackal	dambe aja jaMnahe “mucuMko mereM, kuM ico gewwa bero nyo ako puyahiM S’ekoruwa” aS’e jamS’a aja dosra siMeta buipumS’a haNihe aS’wa siMeko lita ako bero mamsirita daspanihe

When the jackal heard how the snake always ate up the eggs, he said, “my friend, those who are cruel and greedy always meet with a bad end. Have no fear, I have already thought of a plan to destroy him	mamsiritaha bero ajaso taMcepu heppajamS’a pueha keitu aMcame hiMnahe. akso mamsiri jaMnahe “epajiMwa kamjombiha tuMsiM matwaso lobi abikowa noitaha eMtapa mejiMme” mucuMkoi, ka ico gewwa jaruwa akoiya heppajamS’a S’ap koiruwa

Oh, do tell me what it is”, said the crow. Then the jackal, fearing he might be over heard, whispered to his friend what he should do to destroy the snake. The crow flew back to his wife and told her about the plan. “It is rather risky”, said the crow. “We shall have to be very careful	a ha tamS’a aja jaMnehe “i hapa jiMkoga? mamsiriha cucuMpa jaMnehe i nwaMhiM baireta mihiMcipa nanuko aibita S’ukaipa heppajamS’a puya hiM S’ekome jaMnahe. dambe aja buimpumS’a takome cabe ajakota hamS’a taMcepu lainahe. “iha aS’iS’e cucum newaga ado eintihi eMtapa jamS’a yuMneruwa” dabe aja jaMnahe

I shall do anything to save my eggs”, said the mother bird bravely 	aja cabe jaMnahe “ka mucuMro heppajamS’a jiMdo keituhiM ka wamS’a ero

So off they flew towards the palace of the king of the country. The palace was not far from the tree in which they lived. They approached a big pond in the palace garden where they saw the royal ladies having a bath. They had laid their golden chains, pearl necklaces and other jewellery on the edge of the pond. The mother bird flew down, picked up a gold chain in her beak and started flying slowly towards the tree in which she lived. When the palace guards saw the bird flying off with the gold chain, they took up their clubs and chased the bird. They saw the bird drop the chain into the hollow of a tree. One of the guards climbed up the tree to get the chain. As he put his hand inside the hole to get the chain, he saw a black snake curled up there. With one hard stroke of his club he killed it and that was the end of the black snake		ako noita abiha ako rajako rajdarbar S’ata buipumS’a hapune taibi yuMwa siMeso rajdarbar S’aha tanaM mattamihe. ako rajdarbarko naMpota ico bagainso ico Tabo pokori nimihe abiha kaMnuwa rajdarbarko meimebi tihua tiMnahe. meimebiha taibiko MetuMko giwatise nanuMta suMwa sun asua ladakei pokiriko doindita yemihe cabe/aima ajaha liS’o buipumS’a ico sunkokei namuS’o yomuS’a S’uka-S’ukapa abiko yuMcaMwa siMeta buipumS’a hanahe rajdarbarko kaMwa diMabiha ajako sunkokei paicpuwa tiMna aS’ua abiha decuM pumS’a ajako nununui gipnahe. kaMwa diMabi ajaha ako siMeko hombeta sunkokei huikapne tiMnahe kaMwa diMaso icoha siMeta sunkokei uipako lokanehe. sunkokei yokako tamS’a siMeko hombeta kuiwa kadanu ipu daS’ua puiha petakoimS’a yuMwa tiMnahe.
